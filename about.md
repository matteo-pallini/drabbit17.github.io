I am a knowledge worker with a few years of experience working with data. I can write decent enough code to be deployed, although I fantasize with the idea that I write clean code.

I am currently working at [Vortexa](https://www.vortexa.com/) making it easier to track oil and gas vessels. Before that I have worked at [Migacore](https://migacore.com/), which eventually got acquired by [Curium](https://www.cirium.com/). Even before that worked for a while at [iwoca](https://www.iwoca.co.uk/). I am from an economics accademic background but then decided to move to tech following the realisation that I like building stuff more than forecasting inflation.

I lived in a bunch of places, including Australia. I now live in London (UK).

I also like climbing and hanging out on mountains, a lot. Unfortunately it's harder for me to fantasize with the idea that I am a good climber.
