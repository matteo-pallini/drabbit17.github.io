I am a knowledge worker with a few years of experience working with data. I can write decent enough code to be deployed, although I fantasize with the idea that I write clean code.

I have worked for a couple of years at [Migacore](https://migacore.com/), which eventually got acquired by [Cirium](https://www.cirium.com/) where I am currently working. Before that I have been working for a while at [iwoca](https://www.iwoca.co.uk/). I am from an economics accademic background but I realised I like building stuff more than forecasting inflation.

I lived in a bunch of places, including Australia. I now live in London (UK), where after 5 years I still enjoy making weather related jokes with brits.

I also like climbing and hanging out on mountains, a lot. Unfortunately it's harder for me to fantasize with the idea that I am a good climber. I like mountains (and saving money) so much that I also made a hiking/climbing/mountaineering price comparison website called [Smart Hiker](https://smarthiker.co.uk/).
