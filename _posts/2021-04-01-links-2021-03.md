Being Y Combinator main goal making start-ups successful in the article she focuses on what skills allowed her to contribute as a founder and how she thinks these are the skills any founder should keep in mind.

Nice [high-level overview](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/03/16/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020-part-2/) on the tools available to enhance Jupyter Notebooks and make them more software development friendly. Few interesting tools/extensions are mentioned. Such as `nbstripou`, a tool that will allow you to only see through git diff only the changes done in the commands within a notebook, rather than the unreadable blob that you will see by default. Or `nbdev`, `Papermill`, which should allow you to parameterize a notebook and effectively turn it into something that could be used as a layer in a pipeline.
